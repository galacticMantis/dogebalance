# Doge Balance

So about this link I'm sharing, It is a web based Dogecoin balance checker hosted on Github. It gives you a simple and easy way to check your dogecoin balance on your phone. What is special about this is that it also lets you check your balance in Virtual and Augmented Reality! 

Basically what it does is uses the dogechain.info API to retrieve your balance and QR code. Then it displays that balance through various methods.

//Features//
1. Easily check your dogecoin balance
2. Enter your public address manually or scan your QR code.
3. Stores your information in a local variable so that you don't have to enter the address every time. Clear browser data or enter a new address to get rid of it.
4. View your dogecoin in AR or VR!
5. Tap the Shibe's face to see your QR code.
6. Tap your balance to see decimals if there are any.


//Directions//

You can either type in your public address, copy and paste, or scan/upload your QR code. Press 'Find my Doge' and your balance should pop up.

Afterwards you can tap the dogecoin to see your QR code, tap the balance to switch to decimal form, or tap the address to view your info on dogechain.info.

OR you can click VR mode and be brought into a full screen experience that allows you to view your Balance in VR. Turn your phone back to portrait to exit VR mode.

The AR Mode button will open a new window but it'll only work in the AR mobile browser Argon4. Which is free on both iOS and Android. It needs one other thing to function correctly, a target. I put together a special image and wallet envelope just for this purpose. You can download and print it through the link. 

Also note that to make the AR gather your information  correctly you must enter your address through the main page using Argon4. Also QR scanning doesn't work with Argon4...So you'll have to copy and paste from the other browser. Sorry about that!
